            <h2 class="text">What is wrong with iPhone 14?</h2>
            <p>The main feature of the new iPhone 14 smartphone is the almost complete absence of innovations compared to last year's iPhone 13. Apple was even too lazy to come up with a new design, but at the same time did not forget to slightly increase the camera block and slightly shift the buttons so that the iPhone 13 cases did not fit the new smartphone.</p>

            <h2 class="text">Advantages of the iPhone 14</h2>
            <p>The positive qualities of IOS include: Speed. Despite the fact that iOS devices usually have much fewer cores, RAM, and in general the characteristics do not seem to be as powerful as Android phones, this does not affect the performance of the device.</p>

            <h2 class="text">What is good about iPhone 12?</h2>
            <p>Here you have a powerful processor, and a new display, and top-end cameras, and wireless charging, and a whole host of other things. But the decisive factor is that this model has now decently fallen in price. This is due both to the release of new iPhones and the fact that this is no longer a new line.</p>
